Code/notes for a pop-up Python session (surprise!) @ NICAR 2018 in Chicago.

If you're reading this, you might be interested in checking out the completed code for a couple of the examples we talked about in our speed-round of an hour -- you'll find those in the `/completed` folder.

First, though, you need to get Python set up on your machine. Basics are [here](completed/18.%20Setting%20up%20Python%20on%20your%20own%20computer.ipynb). Ping me if you get stuck <cody@ire.org>.

Once you get everything sorted:
- Activate your virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from your terminal
- Run `jupyter notebook` from your terminal
